In the continuing flurry of research activity within physics and mathematics on the properties of networks,
a particular recent focus has been the analysis of communities within networks. In the simplest case, a
network or graph can be represented as a set of points,
or vertices, joined in pairs by lines, or edges. Many networks, it is found, are inhomogeneous, consisting not
of an undifferentiated mass of vertices, but of distinct
groups. Within these groups there are many edges between vertices, but between groups there are fewer edges.
The ability to find communities within large networks
in some automated fashion could be of considerable use.
Communities in a web graph for instance might correspond to sets of web sites dealing with related topics, while communities in a biochemical network or an electronic circuit might correspond to functional units of some kind.
